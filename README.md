## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

It took more time than I imagined to complete this challenge, as Iâ€™m not really used to working with lists and tables. Customizing the bullet points and list counters is not so intuitive, so I had to do some research.

### Continued development

I approached this challenge with a mobile-first vision. Working on a desktop PC makes us forget that nowadays the majority of web users browse with a smartphone, so this should be the standard paradigm of web development.

### Useful resources

- [CSS: colored bullets and list numbers (W3)](https://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/color-bullets.en.html) - This helped me to customize the bullet points and list numbers.
